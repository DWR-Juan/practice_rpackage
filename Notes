# Notes

- Creating packages serves two main use cases:
  - Mechanism to redistribute reusable code (even if just for yourself)
  - Mechanism to reproducibly document analysis and models and their results.

- create_package() will create a top-level directory structure, including a number of critical files under the standard R package structure.
  - DESCRIPTION file: metadata about package.

- If your R code depends on functions from another package, then you must declare so in the `Imports` list in the `DESCRIPTION` file for your package.
  - You can do this with `usethis::use_package("<Package-Name>")

- Questions:
  - How does licensing work?
  - What was up with that warning message that I got at the beginning of the process?
